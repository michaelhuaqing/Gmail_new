Dear Beloved One,
Greeting to you,

I know that this letter will be a very big surprise to you, I just came
across your email contact from my personal search, I=92m a business woman
from France dealing with gold exportation here in Republic of Faso. I was
diagnosed with ovarian cancer disease which doctors have confirmed that i
have short period of time to leave, Now that I=92m ending the race like thi=
s,
without any family members and no child, I have decided to hand over the
sum of ($750.000.00) in my account to you for the help of orphanage
homes/the needy once in your location to fulfill my wish on earth. You may
be wondering why I chose you. But someone lucky has to be chosen according
to the revelation I heard after my prayers today.

But before handing over my data=92s to you, kindly assure me that you will
take only 50% of the money and share the rest to orphanage homes/the needy
once, respond quickly to enable me forward you the bank contact details and
my valid International passport now that I have access to internet before
it will be too late as the bank is aware of my decision over the fund and
awaiting for whom i instructed to contact them forward a scanned copy of my
valid international passport for their confirmation, Note that it will only
cost you for change of ownership according to the bank, and please don=92t =
be
discouraged about the change of ownership because at this stage if no one
apply for the money it will go to bank treasury when I=92m gone and they wi=
ll
not use it to help the needy once to fulfill my wish,

Remain Bless
Mrs N Marois
